Firsly, a proxy is simply something that reroutes your internet traffic and 
masks your IP address conceiving itself as the endpoint. A proxy means that you 
are running the Minecraft client on your local computer and shuting your 
computer of would mean that the bot would disconnect.

If on the other hand you want to run the client on the remote server (computer) 
and be able to shutdown your local computer you need to create a local 
communication client that is only made to communicate with the remote Minecraft 
bot client. This way you would be able to connect to your remote server whenever 
and send commands to the remote Minecraft client.

You could interact with the bot through chat if you create a mod that interupts 
certain messages and forward it to the communication client 

All a proxy does is to mask you IP address.

Optimal Solution where the minecraft bot client is running on a seperate 
computer which means it can run at all times.
